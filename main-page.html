<p>As the globalization is evolving and cooperation is being enhanced, countries are conducting foreign trades at daily basis in order to generate revenues via exports and satisfy domestic needs
    by imports. In addition, in 2020, the covid outbreak impacted the world significantly. The United States has been a critical role in the foreign trade as it has a gigantic market and
    significant amount of domestic needs. The main goal of this project is to exhibit and analyze data from different aspects of international trade, providing a comprehensive analysis and description
    in order to assist audiences with understanding the current status of foreign trade activities.
